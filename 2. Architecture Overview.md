# 2. Architecture Overview
Oracle is available on every platform. But the physical architecture of Oracle looks different on different operating systems
- UNIX/Linux: implemented as many different operating system processes, virtually a process per major function
- Windows: implemented as a single process with multiple threads

# Oracle Database Types
## Database and instance
In the earliest versions of Oracle, there was usually a one-to-one relationship between an instance and a database
- An instance refers to the processes and memory of Oracle.
- A database refers to the physical files that hold data
- A database may be accessible from many instances, but an instance will provide access to exactly one database (regardless of database type) at a time

## Single-Tenant (Non-container) Database

A _single-tenant database_ or _non-container_ database is a self-contained set of datafiles, control files, redo log files, parameter files, and so on that include all of the Oracle metadata (the definition of `ALL_OBJECTS`, for example), Oracle data, and Oracle code (such as the code for `DBMS_OUTPUT`), in addition to all of the application metadata, data, and code

![Figure 2-1: Oracle’s single-tenant (non-container database) architecture.png](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_1.png)

## Single-Tenant (Non-container) RAC Database

Multiple RAC instances run on different servers (nodes or hosts). All of the instances share the same database (files on disk)

The RAC database is designed for high availability, performance, and scalability. The idea is that you can add more instances (nodes) as you need more CPU and memory processing power. This feature requires an extra license from Oracle to use.

![Figure 2-2: Oracle’s single-tenant (non-container database) architecture in a two-node RAC configuration.png](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_2.png)

- The client connects to a special Single Client Access Name (SCAN) RAC listener, and hands off the connection request to one of the database listeners
- Each instance uses the same physical ORCL database
- The RAC software handles the complexity of multiple instances potentially simultaneously accessing the same blocks of data in the single set of database datafiles.
  - RAC configuration requires the Grid Infrastructure software, which includes the Automatic Storage Management (ASM) software for managing the shared disk

## Multitenant Container Database

A _multitenant container database (CDB)_ or _root container database_ is a self-contained set of datafiles, control files, redo log files, parameter files, and so on that only include the Oracle metadata, Oracle data, and Oracle code.
There are no application objects or code in these datafiles—only Oracle-supplied metadata and Oracle-supplied code objects. This database is self-contained in that it can be mounted and opened without any other supporting physical structures.

A _pluggable database (PDB)_ is a set of datafiles only. It is not self-contained. A pluggable database needs a container database to be “plugged into” to be opened and accessible.

### CDBs
A CDB contains one or more user-created PDBs and application containers.

At the physical level, a CDB is a set of files: control file, online redo log files, and data files. The database instance manages the files that make up the CDB.

![Database Instance and CDB](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_7.png)

### PDBs

A PDB is a portable collection of schemas, schema objects, and nonschema objects that appears to an application as a separate database.

At the physical level, each PDB has its own set of data files that store the data for the PDB. The CDB includes all the data files for the PDBs contained within it, and a set of system data files that store metadata for the CDB itself.

To move or archive a PDB, you can unplug it. An unplugged PDB consists of the PDB data files and a metadata file. An unplugged PDB is not usable until it is plugged in to a CDB.

![img_8.png](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_8.png)

(`MYCDB` contains two PDBs: `hrpdb` and `salespdb`)

### Application Containers
An application container is an optional, user-created container within a CDB that stores data and metadata for one or more applications.

For example, a SaaS deployment can use multiple application PDBs, each for a separate customer, which share application metadata and data

For example, in the following figure, sales_app is the application model in the application root. 
- The application PDB named `cust1_pdb` contains sales data only for customer 1, 
- The application PDB named `cust2_pdb` contains sales data only for customer 2. 
- Plugging, unplugging, cloning, and other PDB-level operations are available for individual customer PDBs.

### Flows

![Figure 2-3: A container database with two pluggable databases.png](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_3.png)

The client can only access data within the pluggable database that the client is currently connected to (PDB1 in this example).

```

- `Container database` will only have Oracle data and metadata in it—just the information Oracle needs to “run.”
  - i.e:  metadata for the `SYS` user, compiled code and source code for objects like `DBMS_OUTPUT` and `UTL_FILE`
- `Pluggable databases` have the “rest” of the database metadata and data
  - i.e: application schema like `SCOTT`, 

A pluggable database is not directly opened by an instance, but rather an Oracle instance must be started and a container database mounted and opened by that instance. 
Once the container instance is up and running, and the container database is opened, that container database may open multiple pluggable databases.

> Note: In Oracle 19c and above, you can have three customer-created pluggable databases in an Enterprise Edition database without any extra licensing required. With the multitenant license, you can have up to 4096 separate pluggable databases in a single container database.

- When you start an Oracle instance, there are many processes associated with it (chapter 5). Each instance is supported by about a hundred or so processes.
- Each instance would have its own SGA (chapter 5). Each SGA would have a cached copy of `DBMS_OUTPUT` in its shared pool and have a redo log buffer

-> Which pluggable databases, can have a single instance with a single container database (the Oracle metadata, code, and data) that provides access to many pluggable databases, each hosting a separate application.

- From the perspective of a developer, a pluggable database is no different from a single-tenant database
- From a DBA perspective, there are many changes in the way a database is administered
  - if a DBA configured a container database for RAC, every pluggable database under that container would be RAC enabled.
  - The same with Data Guard, RMAN backups, and so on

## Multitenant RAC Database

![Figure 2-4A two-node RAC container database with two pluggable databases.png](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_4.png)

In this configuration, the client is connected to the `CDB1` instance and accessing the `PDB1` pluggable database

## Sharded Database

Starting with Oracle 12.2, the sharded database feature is a logical database that is horizontally partitioned across a pool of physical databases that don’t share any hardware infrastructure (consists of one or more physical databases)

![Horizontal Partitioning of a Table Across Shards](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_10.png)

Oracle Sharding Architecture

![Oracle Sharding Architecture](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_11.png)

The database shards can be single instance or multi-instance RAC databases. When creating a table, a column needs to be specified as the distribution key.

![Figure 2-5A sharded database that contains three database shards](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_5.png)

Key benefits of sharding for OLTP applications include 
- linear scalability, 
- fault containment,
- geographical data distribution

Each database shard is self-contained, meaning each shard will have its own SGA and background processes. 

Unlike RAC, where multiple instances share the same set of physical database files, sharding is multiple databases (each with its own instance) presented to the end user as one logical database.

# The SGA (System global area) and Background Processes

Each Oracle instance has a large chunk of memory called the SGA:
* Maintain many internal data structures that all processes need access to.
* Cache data from disk; buffer redo data before writing it to disk.
* Hold parsed SQL plans.
* ...

Oracle has a set of processes that are “attached” to this SGA:
- In a UNIX/Linux environment, the processes will physically attach to a large shared memory segment, a chunk of memory allocated in the OS that may be accessed by many processes concurrently (generally using `shmget()` and `shmat()`).
- In Windows, these processes simply use the C call, `malloc()`

# Connecting to Oracle

_dedicated server_ and _shared server_ connections

## Dedicated Server

```bash 
$ sqlplus system/foo@localhost:1521/PDB1

# The output showing only the dedicated server process. When we log out, the extra process/thread will go away
$ ps -ef | grep $ORACLE_SID
oracle   24443     1  0 02:03 ?        00:00:00 oracleCDB (LOCAL=NO)
```

![Figure 2-6Typical dedicated server configuration](..%2F..%2Fimages%2Fimg_6.png)

## Shared Server
Wouldn’t see an additional thread created or a new UNIX/Linux process appear for each user connection.

> Note: In older versions of Oracle, a shared server was known as a multithreaded server or MTS. That legacy name is not in use anymore.

In a shared server, Oracle uses a pool of shared processes for a large community of users. 

Instead of having 10,000 dedicated servers for 10,000 database sessions (máy chắc chắn chết), a shared server lets us have a small percentage of these processes or threads, which are shared by all sessions

In shared server mode, the shared processes are generally started up with the database and appear in the `ps` list
