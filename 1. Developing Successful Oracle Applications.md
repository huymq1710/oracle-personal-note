# 1. Developing Successful Oracle Applications

# My Approach

I have a pretty simple mantra when it comes to developing database software, one that has been consistent for many years:
* You should do it in a single SQL statement if at all possible. And believe it or not, it is almost always possible. This statement is even truer as time goes on. SQL is an extremely powerful language.
* If you can’t do it in a single SQL statement, do it in PL/SQL—as little PL/SQL as possible! Follow the saying that goes “more code = more bugs, less code = less bugs.”
* If you can’t do it in PL/SQL, do it in a C external procedure. This is most frequently the approach when raw speed or using a third-party API written in C is needed.
* If you can’t do it in a C external routine, you might want to seriously think about why it is you need to do it.

# Summary
If you are developing with Oracle:
- Need to understand the Oracle architecture
- Need to understand locking and concurrency control and that every database implements these features _differently_
  - If you don’t, your database will give “wrong” answers, and you will have large contention issues, leading to poor performance.
- Do not reinvent the wheel. 
  - Read the Oracle Database Concepts guide—the New Features guide
  - If you reinvent the wheel over and over, you will never come close to keeping up with the frantic pace of development
- Using as much of Oracle’s built-in functionality as possible
- It is not about the application—it is about the data.
  - Don't make when need data, must come through application
  - re-use
  - ad hoc query
